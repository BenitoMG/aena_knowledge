## 1.  INTRODUCTION

Royal Decree-Law 13/2010, of December 3, has introduced an important modernization process, dividing the airport and air navigation management functions that in Spain had been performed by the  Entidad  Pública  Empresarial  Aena,  with  the  objective  of  improving  the  efficiency  and effectiveness of the Spanish airport system.

Aena Aeropuertos is created within this modernization process and it shall be responsible for the management of the airports which until now had been managed by Entidad Pública Empresarial Aena.

The Council of Ministers on June 3, 2011 approved an agreement which authorizes the asset transfer from Aena to Aena Aeropuertos and a rise in the capital stock of the new company. These measures are necessary for Aena Aeropuertos to start functioning effectively, from June 8, 2011.

Aena Aeropuertos shall carry out all the duties and obligations developed by Entidad Pública Empresarial Aena until June 7, 2011 as regards management and operation of airport services, and any others that national or international law gives to the airport operator, in relation to the network integrated by airports and heliports managed by Aena.

From July 5, 2014, Aena Aeropuertos S.A changes its name into Aena SME, S.A. The airports and heliports that it manages are the following:

Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas and Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat.

Alicante Elche, Gran Canaria, Tenerife Sur, Málaga-Costa del Sol and Palma de Mallorca.

Bilbao, Fuerteventura, Girona, Ibiza,  César Manrique-Lanzarote, Menorca, Santiago, Sevilla, Tenerife Norte and Valencia.

Almería, Asturias, Coruña, Granada-Jaén, Jerez, La Palma, Reus, Seve Ballesteros, Santander, Vigo and Zaragoza.

Albacete, Algeciras, Badajoz, Burgos, Ceuta, Córdoba, Madrid Cuatro Vientos, Hierro, Huesca, La Gomera, León, Logroño, Melilla, Sabadell, Salamanca, San Sebastián, Son Bonet, Pamplona, Vitoria and Valladolid.

## 1.1. PROCEDURE TO OPERATE

Flights landing, taking-off or flying over the Spanish territory shall be subject to the Spanish law as regards civil aviation and to the public security, police and penal regulations in force in Spain.

Information about requirements and authorizations needed to operate in Spain is available on the AIS website (https://www.enaire.es/services/ais).

In order to optimize the use of the capacities available in airports under the Spanish sovereignty, it is needed to coordinate arrival and departure hours of every commercial flight to avoid congestions and delays. Therefore, every flight operating in Adolfo Suarez Madrid Barajas and commercial flights operating in other Aena airports shall coordinate their service times through:

## Asociación Española para la Coordinación y Facilitación de Franjas Horarias (AECFA)

Edificio de Servicios Generales

Avda. Central, 1 - Oficce 422 4 th Floor.

Centro de Carga Aérea. Aeropuerto de Adolfo Suárez Madrid Barajas

28042 Madrid

Tf: +34-913 937 750

Fax: +34-913 937 751

E-mail: slot.coord.admin@aecfa.es

www.slotcoordination.es

In order to operate at Spanish airports, it will be necessary to complete the form: 'Formulario Estadístico de Tránsito Aéreo' both at arrival and departure.

## AIRPORT SERVICE TIMETABLE:

Service times of Spanish airports are duly published and updated in de AD card of each airport of AIP Spain.

## 1.2. REVENUE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE FOR AIRPORT CHARGES DETERMINED BY THE MTOW

## Definition of Maximum Take-Off Weight

Article 72.3 of Law 21/2003 defines the Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) as the maximum certified take-off weight of the aircraft, expressed in metric tonnes, as appearing on the airworthiness certificate. In the event the weight is not known, the weight of the heaviest known aircraft of the same type will be used.

## Information to be provided regarding the MTOW of aircraft

In  order  to  correctly  calculate  the  airport  charges,  aircraft  operators  must  send  the documentation proving the MTOW  of  the aircraft to the following address: tablas.corporativas.flotas@aena.es

Such notification should be made at the time of the change in the characteristics of the aircraft, or at the issuance of the certificate in the case of an aircraft operating for the first time.

To demonstrate the validity of the MTOW or its changes, a copy of the airworthiness certificate or the flight manual of the aircraft may be submitted, and failing that, a copy of the official noise certificate in accordance with the provisions of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, or document of similar characteristics and validity issued by the State of registration of the aircraft.

If the relevant MTOW data has not been provided, the highest known weight for the ICAO category of the aircraft will be charged. For this purpose, the reference will be the EASA database.

## Information to be provide regarding aircraft noise

Prior to the flight departure, air carriers shall submit a copy of the official noise certificate in accordance with the provisions of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, or a document of similar characteristics and validity issued by the State of registration of the aircraft.

For the purposes of acoustic classification, those aircraft whose operators do not provide a noise  certificate  will  be  consider  within  the  same  category  as  an  aircraft  of  the  same manufacturer, model, type and number of engines for which a certificate is available until the corresponding certificate is accredited.

## 1.3. GOVERNING LAWS

Law 18/2014 of 15 October, provides the regulatory framework for basic airport services.

This  Law  observes  the  principle  of  legal  reservation  regarding  the  regulation  of  airport revenues, Law 21/2003, amended by Law 1/2011 of 4 March.

This guide shows the basic airport services charges, that revenues generated by them are considered as public patrimonial benefits, prices for commercial services and charges of services provided by entities other than Aena (Aena has the duty of their invoicing but incomes collected are not part of Aena's revenues).

## 2.1.4 Surcharges according to the noise level of the aircraft

At Alicante-Elche, Barcelona-El Prat, Bilbao, Gran Canaria, Ibiza, Adolfo Suarez Madrid-Barajas, Málaga-Costa del Sol, Palma de Mallorca, Sevilla, Tenerife North, Tenerife South and Valencia Airports, for civil subsonic jet airplanes, the amounts resulting from the application of the amounts referred to in points 2.1.1 to 2.1.3. of this section shall be increased by the following percentages according to the noise level of each aircraft and to the schedule of the landing or take off:

| Noise category   | 07:00 - 22:59  (local time)   | 23:00 - 06:59  (local time)   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Category 1       | 70%                           | 140%                          |
| Category 2       | 20%                           | 40%                           |
| Category 3       | 0%                            | 0%                            |
| Category 4       | 0%                            | 0%                            |

The criterion applied to determine the noise category for each aircraft is as follows:

- -Category 1: Aircrafts with accumulative margin up to 5 EPNdB.
- -Category 2: Aircrafts with accumulative margin between 5 EPNdB and 10 EPNdB.
- -Category 3: Aircrafts with accumulative margin between 10 EPNdB and 15 EPNdB.
- -Category 4: Aircrafts with accumulative margin over 15 EPNdB.

Accumulative margin: The figure, in EPNdB (Effective Perceived Noise in Decibels), is obtained after summing up the differences between noise calculated and noise certificated at each of the three points of reference defined in the Convention on International Civil Aviation, volume 1, second part, chapter 3, annex 16.

## 2.1.5 Training and school flights.

## Definition:

Training flights are those performed for pilot training or qualification in order to confirm or keep licenses.

School flights are those for the purpose of teaching and training pilots, carried out in school or flying club aircraft authorized by Agencia Estatal de Seguridad Aérea (Air Security State Agency), provided that the beginning and the end of the operation is performed at the same airport. Student pilots will be required to prove their status when presenting the Flight Plan to the Oficina de Notificación de los Servicios de Tránsito Aéreo (Air Traffic Services Notification Office)

## 2.4  USE OF AIR BRIDGES

## Definition :

Use of airport facilities to provide boarding and disembarking services to passengers through air bridges or the use of an apron position that impedes the use of air bridges to other users.

Taxpayer The company that runs the aircraft.

Rates : This rate will be calculated by considering the aircraft's weight and time at the air bridge with the following formula:

P = (p1 + p2*Tm)*Ft , where:

- P: Total amount to pay for the service.
- p1: unit rate for the time in position at air bridge.

p2: unit rate for the aircraft's weight and time at the air bridge.

Tm: Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) as the maximum certified take-off weight of the aircraft, expressed in metric tonnes, as appearing on the airworthiness certificate. In the event the weight is not known, the weight of the heaviest known aircraft of the same type will be used.

- Ft : time that the aircraft remains at the air bridge, per 15 minutes or period.

Unit rates for p1 and p2 are shown in the table below:

| Airport                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | p 1 (€)   | p 2  (€)   |

For those aircrafts connected to more than an air bridge simultaneously, and parked in apron positions specially designed for this purpose, the rates for each additional air bridge will be reduced by 75%.

Between zero and six, local time, when an aircraft is in an apron position and the operating company requests a remote parking position but at that time that place is not available, or if the airport operator decides not to change it due to operational reasons, the airport shall disconnect the apron service and shall interrupt the computation of time for charging purposes. However, the company will be forced to move the aircraft to a remote parking position when it will be required because there is available position or because the previous reasons have disappeared. Failure to do this and the fact that it cannot be used by any other users, upon request, the rate to apply will be the one that would have been payable if such uses are not made.

## Rates

## · Electricity supply

The amount to be invoiced will be the amount corresponding to the sum of two concepts:

- o Consumption  term:  variable  amount  corresponding  to  the  electrical  energy consumption made
- o Power term: Fixed monthly amount for the design power of each type of space

The tariff price of the consumption term will be calculated by dividing the amount of the periodic invoice from the service supplier by the number of units consumed throughout the airport network. By multiplying this value by the consumption carried out in the space, the amount to be invoiced for this term will be determined.

The power term will be calculated by applying a coefficient dependent on the type of space to the units or surface of the space occupied with electrical supply. The coefficients to apply will be the following:

|                                                                                         | Ri (€/unit/month)   | Ri (€/m 2 /month)   |

This incentive will apply at a rate that has already taken into account all applicable incentives and discounts to La Palma Airport related to the passenger charge 1 .

Airlines can apply for this incentive until the 31st of January 2025. From that date onwards and before the 28th of February 2025, Aena shall accrue the incentive.

Once the incentive has been approved, Aena shall compensate the corresponding amount with any sums due by the beneficiaries, although this may not be possible in whole or in part by paying it in cash. In all cases, a breakdown of the monthly amounts to which the incentive will be applied will be made.

## III. Extraordinary Incentive for La Palma Island Flights in 2025

This incentive means a 100% refund of the provision of airport facilities charge (passenger charge) in all flights that occur between the 1st of January 2025 to the 31st of December 2025 with a takeoff from La Palma and arriving in Mainland Spain, Balearic  Islands or an International destination. It is worth clarifying that this charge does not accrue on arrivals.

This commercial incentive shall not be accumulated with any other potential incentives that Aena may approve with effect on the passenger charge.

To access this incentive, companies must be up to date with payments to Aena S.M.E., S.A.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to refuse to apply the incentive if during the revision of the data and documents provided by companies that have applied to it, it emerges that the application or any information or documentation provided is affected by errors, misleading information, omissions, or any type of inaccuracy.

## IV. Commercial Incentive for contribution to passenger growth on routes operated from airports with less than 3 million annual passengers 2024-2025-2026

Airlines shall be entitled to the incentives explained under this heading. The incentives are applicable in the Summer and Winter seasons of 2024, Summer and Winter 2025 and Summer and Winter 2026. Seasons are defined in article 72.16 1 of Law 21/2003 of 7 th July on Air Safety and they are considered independently.

The incentive is for contributing to the growth in the number of passengers on routes operated from airports in the network with less than 3 million passengers  annually in 2023 (Annex I), applicable in the summer and winter seasons of 2024, 2025, and 2026.

The incentive will be calculated as an amount equivalent to 100% of the average departure passenger charge (with two decimal figures) of the airline per route. The incentives shall apply exclusively to the number of additional departure passengers on the route concerned compared to the 2023 equivalent season that the airline carried at each airport of the Aena S.M.E., S.A 's network and Murcia Region International Airport (AIRM).

The incentive will be proportional to the contribution to the growth generated in that route by each of the airlines operating it.

In all the above, the number of passengers considered for the incentive of each airline will have the cap on the number of passengers that the airline has grown at the airport. In this case, their distribution by route will be proportional to the contribution of the airline to the growth of each route.

Additionally, for each airline, the number of passengers considered at route level will not be higher than its growth in the network of Aena S.M.E., S.A and AIRM. In this case, the distribution per route will be proportional to the passengers referred to in the previous paragraph.

To calculate the incentive, the number of passengers eligible for the incentive shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.

For the purpose of this incentive, a route is defined as the set of commercial 2 passenger air transport operations, departing from an Aena, S.M.E., S.A airport and destined to another airport. It will be considered as the same route to the same destination, the one that even when operated to different airports, these are part of the same catchment area (Annex II).

Furthermore, airlines must request the incentive through the incentive application form, available on the Aena website, at the beginning of each season and before the following months end:

- o October 2024 for the summer season 2024 (from April 2024 to October 2024)
- o October 2025 for the summer season 2025 (from April 2025 to October 2025)
- o October 2026 for the summer season 2026 (from April 2026 to October 2026)
- o March 2025 for the winter season 2024 (from November 2024 to March 2025)
- o March 2026 for the winter season 2025 (from November 2025 to March 2026)
- o March 2027 for the winter season 2026 (from November 2026 to March 2027)

To be considered an operated route for the season the route to a specific destination must exceed 1000 departing commercial passengers in the winter season and 1500 in the summer season.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. will communicate whether the airline is eligible for the incentive in December for the summer seasons and in May of the following year for the winter seasons.

Aena S.M.E., S.A.  shall compensate the corresponding amount with any amounts owed by the beneficiaries. If it is not possible in whole or in part, it will be paid in cash.

To benefit from the incentive, the Financial Directorate must issue a favourable report based on the overall situation of the company's account with Aena, its risk coverage, and the regular compliance with its payment system.

The airline will not be entitled to the incentive if, with the intention of benefiting from it or influencing its amount, the company had been the recipient of the assignment or transfer of operations between itself and companies within the same group or with other companies with which it may share its program or align strategies.

If the situations described above arise as a result of purely operational aspects of the activity of companies within the same group that may share their program, or mergers, acquisitions, or changes in ownership of airlines that could affect the outcome of this incentive, Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to reduce the amount corresponding to the incentive. This will be made in proportion to the impact of the activity transfer carried out or to treat such companies as a single airline.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to refuse to apply the incentive if during the revision of the data and documents provided by companies that have applied to it, it emerges that the application or any information or documentation provided is affected by errors, misleading information, omissions, or any type of inaccuracy.

## V. Commercial Incentive for contribution to passenger growth on routes operated from airports with less than 3 million annual passengers 2024-2025-2026. Update for airports which have not recovered 2019 passenger traffic levels in 2025 - 2026.

Airlines  shall  be  entitled  to  the  incentives  explained  under  this  heading.  The  incentive  is applicable in the Summer and Winter seasons of 2024, 2025 and 2026 and the updated incentive for airports that have not recovered 2019 passenger traffic levels is applicable in the Summer and Winter seasons of 2025 and 2026. Seasons are defined in article 72.16 1 of Law 21/2003 of 7th July on Air Safety and they are considered independently.

The aim of the incentive is to contribute to the growth in the number of passengers on routes operated from airports in the network with less than 3 million passengers annually in 2023 (Annex I), applicable in the summer and winter seasons of 2024, 2025, and 2026.

The incentive is calculated as an amount equivalent to 100% of the average departure passenger charge (with two decimal figures) of the airline per route. The incentives apply exclusively to the number of additional departure passengers on the route concerned compared to the 2023 equivalent season that the airline carried at each airport of the Aena S.M.E., S.A's network and Murcia Region International Airport (AIRM).

The incentive is proportional to the contribution to the growth generated in that route by each of the airlines operating it.

In all the above, the number of passengers considered for the incentive of each airline has the cap on the number of passengers that the airline has grown at the airport. In this case, their distribution by route is proportional to the contribution of the airline to the growth of each route.

January 2025 ed

Additionally, for each airline, the number of passengers considered at route level will not be higher than its growth in the network of Aena S.M.E., S.A and AIRM. In this case, the distribution per route will be proportional to the passengers referred to in the previous paragraph.

To calculate the incentive, the number of passengers eligible for the incentive is rounded to the nearest whole number.

The update of the incentive consists of adding to the previous incentive, and applicable during 2025 and 2026 seasons compared to its equivalent 2023 season, an additional refund of a 100% of the average airport security charge and PRM charge in those airports with less than 3 million annual passengers that have not recovered the passenger's traffic figures of 2019 (cumulative data as of August 2024, please refer to Annex II). It applies to the number of passengers eligible for the incentive described above. The growth must be on routes that do not overlap with routes operated by another airline in the same season.

For the purpose of this incentive, a route is defined as the set of commercial1 passenger air transport operations, departing from an Aena, S.M.E., S.A airport and destined to another airport. It will be considered as the same route to the same destination, the one that even when operated to different airports, these are part of the same catchment area (Annex III).

Furthermore, airlines must request the incentive through the incentive application form, available on the Aena website, at the beginning of each season and before the following months end:

- o October 2024 for the summer season 2024 (from April 2024 to October 2024)
- o October 2025 for the summer season 2025 (from April 2025 to October 2025)
- o October 2026 for the summer season 2026 (from April 2026 to October 2026)
- o March 2025 for the winter season 2024 (from November 2024 to March 2025)
- o March 2026 for the winter season 2025 (from November 2025 to March 2026)
- o March 2027 for the winter season 2026 (from November 2026 to March 2027)

<https://www.aena.es/en/airlines/incentives-and-marketing-support/incentives.html>

To be considered an operated route for the season the route to a specific destination must exceed 1000 departing commercial passengers in the winter season and 1500 in the summer season.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. will communicate whether the airline is eligible for the incentive in December for the summer seasons and in May of the following year for the winter seasons.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. shall compensate the corresponding amount with any amounts owed by the beneficiaries. If it is not possible in whole or in part, it will be paid in cash.

To benefit from the incentive, the Financial Directorate must issue a favourable report based on the overall situation of the company's account with Aena, its risk coverage, and the regular compliance with its payment system.

The airline will not be entitled to the incentive if, with the intention of benefiting from it or influencing its amount, the company had been the recipient of the assignment or transfer of operations between itself and companies within the same group or with other companies with which it may share its program or align strategies.

If the situations described above arise as a result of purely operational aspects of the activity of companies within the same group that may share their program, or mergers, acquisitions, or changes in ownership of airlines that could affect the outcome of this incentive, Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to reduce the amount corresponding to the incentive. This will be made in proportion to the impact of the activity transfer carried out or to treat such companies as a single airline.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to refuse to apply the incentive if during the revision of the data and documents provided by companies that have applied to it, it emerges that the application or any information or documentation provided is affected by errors, misleading information, omissions, or any type of inaccuracy.

## VI. Commercial incentive for new routes to destinations not served at airports with more than 3 million passengers 2024-2025-2026

Airlines shall be entitled to the incentives explained under this heading. The incentives are applicable in the Summer and Winter seasons of 2024, Summer and Winter 2025 and Summer and Winter 2026. Seasons are defined in article 72.16 1 of Law 21/2003 of 7 th July on Air Safety and they are considered independently.

The incentive is for the launch of routes to new destinations for the airport, from airports in the network with more than 3 million annual passengers in 2023 (Annex I), applicable in the summer and winter seasons of 2024, 2025, and 2026, except for routes with Asia as the destination (Annex II)

The incentive will be calculated as an amount equivalent to 100% of the average departure passenger charge (with two decimal figures) of the airline per route. The incentives shall apply exclusively to the number of additional departure passengers on the route concerned compared to the previous equivalent season that the airline carried at each airport of the Aena S.M.E., S.A 's network.

The incentive will be proportional to the contribution to the growth generated in that route by each of the airlines operating it.

In all the above, the number of passengers considered for the incentive of each airline will have the cap on the number of passengers that the airline has grown at the airport. In this case, their distribution by route will be proportional to the contribution of the airline to the growth of each route.

Additionally, for each airline, the number of passengers considered at route level will not be higher than its growth in the network of Aena S.M.E., S.A and AIRM. In this case, the distribution per route will be proportional to the passengers referred to in the previous paragraph.

To calculate the incentive, the number of passengers eligible for the incentive shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.

For the purpose of this incentive, a route is defined as the set of commercial 1 passenger air transport operations, departing from an Aena, S.M.E., S.A airport and destined to another airport. It will be considered as the same route to the same destination, the one that even when operated to different airports, these are part of the same catchment area (Annex III).

Furthermore, airlines must request the incentive through the incentive application form, available on the Aena website, at the beginning of each season and before the following months end:

- o October 2024 for the summer season 2024 (from April 2024 to October 2024)
- o October 2025 for the summer season 2025 (from April 2025 to October 2025)
- o October 2026 for the summer season 2026 (from April 2026 to October 2026)
- o March 2025 for the winter season 2024 (from November 2024 to March 2025)
- o March 2026 for the winter season 2025 (from November 2025 to March 2026)
- o March 2027 for the winter season 2026 (from November 2026 to March 2027)

<https://www.aena.es/en/airlines/incentives-and-marketing-support/incentives.html>

For the purpose of  this incentive, it is considered that a route to a destination has not been operated in the previous equivalent season if it did not exceed 1000 departing passengers in the winter season or 1500 in the summer season.

To be considered an operated route for the season the route to a specific destination must exceed 1000 departing passengers in the winter season and 1500 in the summer season.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. will communicate whether the airline is eligible for the incentive in December for the summer seasons and in May of the following year for the winter seasons.

Aena, S.M.E., S.A. shall compensate the corresponding amount with any amounts owed by the beneficiaries If it is not possible in whole or in part, it will be paid in cash.

To benefit from the incentive, the Financial Directorate must issue a favourable report based on the overall situation of the company's account with Aena, its risk coverage, and the regular compliance with its payment system.

The airline will not be entitled to the incentive if, with the intention of benefiting from it or influencing its amount, the company had been the recipient of the assignment or transfer of operations between itself and companies within the same group or with other companies with which it may share its program or align strategies.

If the situations described above arise as a result of purely operational aspects of the activity of companies within the same group that may share their program, or mergers, acquisitions, or changes in ownership of airlines that could affect the outcome of this incentive, Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to reduce the amount corresponding to the incentive. This will be made in

proportion to the impact of the activity transfer carried out or to treat such companies as a single airline.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to refuse to apply the incentive if during the revision of the data and documents provided by companies that have applied to it, it emerges that the application or any information or documentation provided is affected by errors, misleading information, omissions or any type of inaccuracy.

## VII. Commercial Incentive for contribution to passenger growth on routes to Asia 20242025-2026

Airlines shall be entitled to the incentives explained under this heading. The incentives are applicable in the Summer and Winter seasons of 2024, Summer and Winter 2025 and Summer and Winter 2026. Seasons are defined in article 72.16 1 of Law 21/2003 of 7 th July on Air Safety and they are considered independently.

The incentive is for contributing to the growth in the number of passengers on routes to Asia (Annex I) operated from all airports in the network, applicable in the summer and winter seasons of 2024, 2025, and 2026.

The incentive will be calculated as an amount equivalent to 100% of the average departure passenger charge (with two decimal figures) of the airline per route. The incentives shall apply exclusively to the number of additional departure passengers on the route concerned compared to the previous equivalent season that the airline carried at each airport of the Aena S.M.E., S.A 's network.

The incentive will be proportional to the contribution to the growth generated in that route by each of the airlines operating it.

In all the above, the number of passengers considered for the incentive of each airline will have the cap on the number of passengers that the airline has grown at the airport. In this case, their distribution by route will be proportional to the contribution of the airline to the growth of each route.

Additionally, for each airline, the number of passengers considered at route level will not be higher than its growth in the network of Aena S.M.E., S.A and AIRM. In this case, the distribution per route will be proportional to the passengers referred to in the previous paragraph.

To calculate the incentive, the number of passengers eligible for the incentive shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.

For the purpose of this incentive, a route is defined as the set of commercial 2 passenger air transport operations, departing from an Aena, S.M.E., S.A, airport and destined to an Asian airport.

Furthermore, airlines must request the incentive through the incentive application form, available on the Aena website, at the beginning of each season and before the following months end:

- o October 2024 for the summer season 2024 (from April 2024 to October 2024)
- o October 2025 for the summer season 2025 (from April 2025 to October 2025)
- o October 2026 for the summer season 2026 (from April 2026 to October 2026)
- o March 2025 for the winter season 2024 (from November 2024 to March 2025)
- o March 2026 for the winter season 2025 (from November 2025 to March 2026)
- o
- March 2027 for the winter season 2026 (from November 2026 to March 2027)

To be considered an operated route for the season the route to a specific destination must exceed 1000 departing passengers in the winter season and 1500 in the summer season.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. will communicate whether the airline is eligible for the incentive in December for the summer seasons and in May of the following year for the winter seasons.

Aena, S.M.E., S.A. shall compensate the corresponding amount with any amounts owed by the beneficiaries. If it is not possible in whole or in part, it will be paid in cash.

To benefit from the incentive, the Financial Directorate must issue a favourable report based on the overall situation of the company's account with Aena, its risk coverage, and the regular compliance with its payment system.

The airline will not be entitled to the incentive if, with the intention of benefiting from it or influencing its amount, the company had been the recipient of the assignment or transfer of operations between itself and companies within the same group or with other companies with which it may share its program or align strategies.

If the situations described above arise as a result of purely operational aspects of the activity of companies within the same group that may share their program, or mergers, acquisitions, or changes in ownership of airlines that could affect the outcome of this incentive, Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to reduce the amount corresponding to the incentive. This will be made in proportion to the impact of the activity transfer carried out or to treat such companies as a single airline.

Aena S.M.E., S.A. reserves the right to refuse to apply the incentive if during the revision of the data and documents provided by companies that have applied to it, it emerges that the application or any information or documentation provided is affected by errors, misleading information, omissions, or any type of inaccuracy.

## IX. Commercial incentive for operational growth of airlines operating widebody cargo aircraft

Airline companies operating widebody cargo aircraft 1 will be entitled to the incentive explained in this section, applicable for additional annual operations, from March 1, 2024, to February 28, 2027.

The incentive will consist of a refund on the average landing fare of each airline, applicable to the additional annual arrival operations, from 1 March, 2024, to 28 February, 2027, operated using widebody cargo aircraft from any airport in the Aena SME, SA network and at the International Airport in the Murcia Region (AIRM).

For each company, if the sum of operations operated with widebody cargo aircraft during the twelve-month period considered is greater than the sum of operations operated with widebody cargo aircraft in the previous twelve-month period at all the airports in the Aena SME, SA network, and at the International Airport in the Murcia Region (AIRM), it will be entitled to receive the incentive, for three consecutive periods as follows:

- -First period (March 1, 2024 -  February 28, 2025) : The amount of the incentive is an amount equal to the number of additional widebody arrival operations for each airline, multiplied by 75% of the average landing fee for each eligible airline.

Once entitlement to the incentive has been acquired, if the company maintains or exceeds the number of operations in the second and third periods, the average landing fee in each of these two periods will be subsidised by 50% (second period) and 25% (third period). If the number of operations is not maintained with respect to the immediately preceding period, the airline will lose the right to continue receiving the incentive.

The additional operations run in period 1 with respect to period 0 are taken as the base reference for quantifying the amount of the incentive in periods 2 and 3.

- -Second period (March 1, 2025 - February 28, 2026) : The amount of the incentive is an amount equal to the number of additional widebody arrival operations for each airline, multiplied by 75% of the average landing fee for each eligible airline.

Once the right to the incentive has been acquired, if the airline maintains or exceeds the number of operations in the third and fourth periods, the average landing rate in each of these two periods will be subsidised by 50% (third period) and 25% (fourth period). If the number of operations is not maintained with respect to the immediately preceding period, the airline will lose the right to continue receiving the incentive.

The additional operations run in period 2 with respect to period 1 are taken as a base reference for quantifying the amount of the incentive in periods 3 and 4.

- -Third period (March 1, 2026 - February 28, 2027) : The amount of the incentive is an amount equal to the number of additional widebody arrival operations of each airline multiplied by 75% of the average landing fee of each eligible airline.

Once entitlement to the incentive has been acquired, if the airline maintains or exceeds the number of operations in the fourth and fifth periods, the average landing fee in each of these two periods will be reimbursed by 50% (fourth period) and 25% (fifth period). If the number of operations is not maintained with respect to the immediately preceding period, the airline will lose the right to continue receiving the incentive.

The additional operations run in period 3 with respect to period 2 are taken as a base reference for quantifying the amount of the incentive in periods 4 and 5.

Periods 4 and 5 are those between March 1, 2027 and February 29, 2028, and between March 1, 2028 and February 28, 2029, respectively.

For the purpose of calculating this incentive, the average landing fee for the corresponding period is the sum of the amount invoiced for the landing fee for widebody cargo aircraft, divided by the total number of arrival operations run using widebody cargo aircraft.

To access this incentive, the airline must equal or exceed 12 widebody arrival operations per period and the type of service must be one of the following: A - Regular additional cargo aircraft, F - Regular cargo aircraft, H - Charter cargo aircraft

New frequencies at JT Barcelona - El Prat airport during congested slots, which are from 17:00 to 22:59 hours (LT), will not be taken into account when applying the incentive. The congested slots may, where appropriate, be revised annually by Aena before the start of each period (1 March, 2025, and 1 March, 2026).

In addition, airlines must apply for the incentive through the incentive application form, available on the Aena website, before the end of each period.

- · Period 1 (March 2024 to February 2025): from March 1, 2024 to February 28, 2025.
- · Period 2 (March 2025 to February 2026): from March 1, 2025 to February 28, 2026.
- · Period 3 (March 2026 to February 2027): from March 1, 2026 to February 28, 2027.

<https://www.aena.es/en/airlines/incentives-and-marketing-support/incentives.html>

Aena SME, SA will communicate whether the airline is entitled to the incentive in the following May for each period defined in this section, and will detail the amount for each of the corresponding periods.

The corresponding amount resulting from the application of this incentive will be offset by Aena SME, SA against any amounts owed by the beneficiaries, this not being possible, in whole or in part, by means of a cash payment.

In order to receive this incentive, the Finance Department must issue a favourable report based on the overall status of the company's account with Aena, its risk cover and the usual compliance with its payment system.

The airline will not be entitled to the incentive if, for the purpose of benefiting from the incentive or having an effect on the incentive amount, the airline is the recipient of an assignment or transfer of operations between itself and airlines in the same group or with other airlines with which it could share its programme or align strategies.

In any case, if the aforementioned situations arise as a result of purely operational aspects of the activity of companies within the same group that may share their programme, or in the event of mergers, acquisitions or any other modification of ownership of airlines that could affect the result of this incentive, Aena SME, SA reserves the right to reduce the amount corresponding to the incentive in proportion to the effect of the transfer of activity carried out or to treat these companies as a single airline.
